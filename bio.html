    <h1 id="earlylife">Early Life</h1>
    <p>Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was born on 17 February 1984 in Warmbad (modern day Bela-Bela), South Africa to Abraham B de Villiers and Millie de Villiers. He has two elder brothers Jan de Villiers and Wessels de Villiers.[19] He described his childhood days as "really relaxed lifestyle up there, where everyone knows everyone".[20] He was educated at Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool in Pretoria along with teammate Faf du Plessis, who was and still remains his good friend. He is a high school graduate. His father was a doctor who had played rugby union in his youth, and he encouraged his son to play sports as a child.[20]</p>
    <h1 id="career">Career</h1>
    <p>De Villiers is a right-handed batter who accumulated 8765 runs in Tests including 22 centuries and 46 fifties. He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),[21] before being dismissed for naught against Bangladesh in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with an unbeaten 278. Until 2012 he was an occasional wicket-keeper for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper Mark Boucher and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to debutant Quinton de Kock.

He holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.

After the 2011 Cricket World Cup he succeeded Graeme Smith as captain of the national ODI side,[22] and became Test captain after the second Test of the home series against England in 2015/16.[23] He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.[24]

AB de Villiers is claimed by many to be a multifaceted, versatile sportsperson, having excelled in various sports such as golf, rugby, tennis, and hockey.[25] But AB himself admitted that he was never good in other sports except cricket like what others claim to be and also insisted that he never considered himself as a child prodigy.[26] He insisted that he was pretty decent at rugby and golf but refused to admit that he held national records in swimming.[27] He openly made such statements to public and has also mentioned it in his autobiography titled AB: The Autobiography, in response to the "falsehoods and exaggerations" about his all-round abilities.[28]</p>

<p>Since joining the league in its inaugural season, de Villiers has become one of the most successful batsmen in the Indian Premier League. After originally playing for Delhi Daredevils, he moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for US$1.5 million in the league's fourth season. Three of his four Twenty20 centuries have come in the IPL and he has played in over 150 matches in the league.[74] Following his retirement from international cricket, his future in T20 franchise leagues was uncertain until he announced in July 2018 that he intended to continue to play in the IPL for "a few years".[66] He announced his retirement from IPL on 19 November 2021 following the conclusion of 14th edition of IPL.[75] He said that he would rejoin RCB for the 2023 season, but not as a player.[76]

On 17 May 2022, de Villiers was inducted into the RCB Hall of Fame for his contributions to the team from 2011 to 2021.[77]</p>
<h1 id="personal life">Personal Life</h1>
<p>De Villiers proposed to his girlfriend, Danielle Swart, at the Taj Mahal in 2012, after five years of dating.[93] The couple got married on 30 March 2013, in Bela-Bela, South Africa. They have two sons and one daughter.[94][95][96]

He is a devout Christian and has stated that his faith is crucial to his approach to life.[97] He is also an accomplished guitar player and a singer. In 2010, he released a bilingual pop album entitled Maak Jou Drome Waar with his friend and South African singer Ampie du Preez.[98] His autobiography, AB de Villiers – the Autobiography, was released in September 2016.[99] He is the most-followed South African on Instagram.[100]</p>
